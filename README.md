# 💼 Introduction

👋🏾 Welcome to our [CoderSchool](https://www.coderschool.vn/) Career Center Resources! The goal of these guides is to demystify the software engineering field and how to set yourself up for success to become a software engineer or in other related positions after you graduate.

### Who is this guide for? <a id="Who-is-this-guide-for"></a>

This guide is specifically targeted for CoderSchool students that are graduating from our courses, and are interested in pursuing a career as a software engineer.

The guide assumes some knowledge of certain technical terms used throughout but is intended to be accessible to those very early within their programming experience. Please contact us if you find anything confusing so we can continue to improve the accessibility of these guides!

### Overview <a id="Overview"></a>

As part of our programs, we offer students direct guidance and feedback on their resumes, LinkedIns and provide coaching and guidance during your job placement. We want to make sure every one of you has a clear pathway to your first \(or next\) great technical job.

There are four major areas we want to help students navigate:

1. **Career Exploration** - Provide you key context on how to succeed as a software engineer
2. **Resume/LinkedIn** - Creating an effective resume and LinkedIn profile
3. **Applying for Jobs**- Sending out your resume and actually applying to companies
4. **Technical Interviews** - Studying and becoming confident in technical internship interviews
