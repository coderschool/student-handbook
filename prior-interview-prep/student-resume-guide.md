# Ô∏èStudent Resume Guide

### Overview <a id="Overview"></a>

Writing a resume might seem pretty straightforward, but there are lots of nuances. After all, it‚Äôs the first thing recruiters will read about you. It‚Äôs crucial to make a good first impression.

And you need to make that impression fast. [Recruiters spend an average of six seconds reviewing a resume.](https://cdn.theladders.net/static/images/basicSite/pdfs/TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf) You heard that right. Six seconds!

Almost all that time is spent on your name, companies, job titles, start/end dates, school, major, and project titles. Everything on your resume should be tailored towards helping recruiters find these key pieces of info as fast as possible.

### If you don‚Äôt have a LinkedIn profile, create one now!

[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/) enables recruiters to find you and helps you maintain your professional network. Plus, you need it for cold-emailing recruiters later. First, search LinkedIn profiles of software engineers for good examples of how a profile should look.

Create your profile, and add as much of the information to the profile as you can. Check out our[ LinkedIn creation guide here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZEMipcNuxG9wZC1RdOgxWaO9Yjlld4NThk4sD_ivbKg/edit) for more information. Treat it as a digital extended resume, and often the LinkedIn profile can be even more detailed than a resume. Include all your work experience, projects, and a summary at the top. Search other LinkedIn profiles of software engineers for good examples.

## Key Resume Guidelines

Here are some important guidelines for your resume:

**What to include:**

* **Professional Skills**
  * Technical skills: languages, frameworks, platforms and tools that you are most familiar with
  * Softskills that you are most confident about: Logical thinking, problem solving skills, teamwork, flexibility, time management, project management,..
* **Projects** that showcase things you‚Äôre passionate about and your technical experience. Include a link for each project if you can.
* Include **links to your GitHub, LinkedIn and a website** \(if applicable\)
* Look at the job description and make sure to include relevant skills/experiences. E.g. if you‚Äôre applying for a web developer role and you‚Äôve used languages they‚Äôre asking for, make sure to list them in the work/project descriptions!

**Easy to scan:**

* Stick to one page \(maximum 2\).
* Keep it black and white if you‚Äôre not skilled at design. Colors are noisy.
* Stick to a standard format \(chronological, no weird fonts, 10.5 to 12 pt font size, 0.5 to 1 inch margins\). Standard formats are more readable by resume-parsing programs and easier to skim by recruiters.
* Keep it concise. Text walls discourage readers.

**Highlight the key points:**

* Make your name big.
* Highlight company names, job titles, start/end dates, school name, major and project titles.
* Important content should be higher up. For your special case, the order of importance is usually Skills Projects &gt; Skills.

**Cut the fluff:**

* Objective and Summary are generally unnecessary. Just nice to have!
* Descriptions should say something tangible. _‚ÄúExceptional team player‚Äù_ doesn‚Äôt work. _‚ÄúIncreased user conversion rates by 20%‚Äù_ does. This should describe the project specifically and quantify impact if possible. 
* People without a technical background will be reading your resume, so get rid of convoluted details.

**Don‚Äôt neglect the details:**

* Include the higher of your cumulative GPA and your major GPA. If they‚Äôre both less than 3.5, leave it off.
* Don‚Äôt include anything you wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable answering questions about. Most people make this mistake when listing their skills.

After finishing your resume, have your peers review it. Ask them to be honest and harsh. If you then want even more tips, check out [this article](https://www.careercup.com/resume).

#### Include CoderSchool classes and projects <a id="You-can-also-include-CodePath-classes-and-projects"></a>

* If you built projects in our courses that are on your github, be sure to include those in a ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù section alongside other portfolio pieces. Be sure to describe the project \(‚ÄúBuilt and published a functional Instagram-like Android app which allows users to share photos with friends and family‚Äù\) **and** include a link to the Github repo.
* CoderSchool is listed as a school in LinkedIn, so you can also add us in your Education section and it should autocomplete with the icon and info. You could include images or even video demo of your app at the end of the course. There‚Äôs also a section in LinkedIn for projects.

## How is a resume actually used?

Once you‚Äôve prepared your resume, you might find it is helpful to think about how the resume is actually used in practice by recruiters. Here are a few examples:

* **Submitting Online**. Searching for your ideal job position on recruitment platforms such as [Vietnamworks](https://www.vietnamworks.com/); [ITviec](https://itviec.com/); [Career Builder](https://careerbuilder.vn/)... A technical recruiter receives a lot of resumes in most cases, and they are the one processing incoming applications. Usually they will spend about 6 seconds reviewing each one, and then quickly sort applicants based on past internship/work experience, school/major, projects, cover letter, and other things that stand out. This will often result in tagging with a üëçüèΩ and üëéüèΩ or a similar scoring mechanic in their tracking system.
* **Career Fairs**. You will hand out your resume at career fairs. The company representative \(usually an engineer or recruiter\) will spend the cursory 6 seconds looking it over, and then ask the ‚Äútell me about yourself‚Äù question. It‚Äôs really important to be able to provide a _concise and enthusiastic pitch_ about why you are interested in the company-- essentially your cover letter in verbal form. At career fairs, many companies actually assign a number to each student about their likelihood to be a good fit.

#### How CoderSchool will refer you to Hiring Partners? <a id="How-is-a-resume-actually-used"></a>

After having the final version of your CV, our Student Outcome Team will

1. Start referring your profile to our 400+ partner companies, with a specific introduction of your background, strengths, weaknesses, and your projects. Then employers will approach you directly for recruitment purposes if your profile is a good fit to their team. 
2. Share your profile on Linkedin where recruiters who are not yet in our database can also reach you for their selection process.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Remember that connecting with people and working through referrals can often **make all the difference in getting access** to a career opportunity. If you can chat with a recruiter on your Linkedin network, at a career fair or at a meetup, you are **significantly more likely to be given a longer look** by them. If you are proactively sending out your resume and actually applying for jobs, interview invitations and offers will come to you much faster than the rest of others just staying still and wish for luck.
